<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/ShivenV/Agar)

2.6 million. That is the number of people who have died from the worldwide virus known as COVID-19 or more commonly known as Coronavirus. This virus has been deadly, no doubt about that. It started in February of 2020, and most people thought that it would have ended by the summer, or at the most by August. And yet, here we are, over a year later, still dealing with the same virus, with little difference in how many people are being infected. This is why I have created Agar, and I think it is one of the best way to stop the spread of COVID.

Here's why:
* It can be easily installed on any device since it is built using the cross platform tech known as React Native.
* Extremely User Friendly and Intuitive Interface.
* Can spice up an otherwise boring process of checking for COVID :smile:

Of course, no one app can completely solve the entire issue, but if I can make an app that can help solve a majority of the problems, then I would consider that as a success.

## More Details

### Built With

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
